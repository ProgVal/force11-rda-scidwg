Because modern research relies on software, it is now a cross-cutting concern
in research for multiple reasons, including communication, reproducibility,
open science/open scholarship, and citation/credit.

“Making software a first-class citizen in the scholarly world” is a one-day
hackathon bringing together a large group of stakeholders who are actively
working to improve the status of  research software in the scholarly environment.

We will discuss a variety of different approaches to make software identifiable,
citable, reusable, and reproducible, and make progress toward a common
understanding of the issues and toward a shared set of guidelines.

During the hackathon there will be  a few presentations about research software
challenges and institutional solutions.

The activities will be organised around 2-4 segments from the following list,
depending on the interests of the participants:

  - Identifiers for software

      - Granularity of identification

      - Correspondence between different identifier schemas

      - Hacking the software citation graph

      - Exploring synergies

   - Metadata interoperability

        - Metadata mapping (CodeMeta)

        - Connections with WikiData

   - Data quality

        - Guidelines and checklists

        - Moderation process

        - Supporting reproducibility

   - Policies and incentives

        - Institutions

        - Evaluation committees

        - National research bodies

        - Learned societies

        - Publishers


These activities will be carried out in parallel tracks, or sequentially,
depending on the number of participants.

The results of each activity will be summarised at the end of the day
during a brainstorming and conclusions session.

We invite researchers, librarians, wikipedians, digital curators,
professional societies, publishers, archives,
indices, funders, institutions, and more generally all persons interested in
software as a research artifact to participate.

In the issues, there is an issue for each track (Identifiers, Metadata
interoperability, Data quality and Policies and incentives).
Please comment the track that interests you.

You are welcome to suggest subjects and activities on specific tracks or
as separate issues.
