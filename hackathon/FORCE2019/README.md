# Research Software Hackathon at FORCE2019
- One day hackathon on October 15th.

## Description

Because modern research relies on software, it is now a cross-cutting concern
in research for multiple reasons, including communication, reproducibility,
open science/open scholarship, and citation/credit.

“Making software a first-class citizen in the scholarly world” is a one-day
hackathon bringing together a large group of stakeholders who are actively
working to improve the status of  research software in the scholarly environment.

We will discuss a variety of different approaches to make software identifiable,
citable, reusable, and reproducible, and make progress toward a common
understanding of the issues and toward a shared set of guidelines.

During the hackathon there will be  a few presentations about research software
challenges and institutional solutions.

## Activities

The activities will be organised around 2-4 segments from the following list,
depending on the interests of the participants:

  - Identifiers for software

      - Granularity of identification

      - Correspondence between different identifier schemas

      - Hacking the software citation graph

      - Exploring synergies

   - Metadata interoperability

        - Metadata mapping (CodeMeta)

        - Connections with WikiData
        
        - Tooling

   - Data quality

        - Guidelines and checklists

        - Moderation process

        - Supporting reproducibility

   - Policies and incentives

        - Institutions

        - Evaluation committees

        - National research bodies

        - Learned societies

        - Publishers


These activities will be carried out in parallel tracks, or sequentially,
depending on the number of participants.

The results of each activity will be summarised at the end of the day
during a brainstorming and conclusions session.

## Join in

We invite researchers, librarians, wikipedians, digital curators,
professional societies, publishers, archives,
indices, funders, institutions, and more generally all persons interested in
